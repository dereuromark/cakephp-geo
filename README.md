A CakePHP 3.x Plugin to
- geocode locations/ips and save the information (lat/lng) along with the records
- reverse geocode data
- display (Google) maps

This plugin requires PHP 5.4+

Note that since CakePHP 3.x upgrade uses the [willdurand/geocoder](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder) library and therefore now supports
- 12+ address-based Geocoder providers
- 10+ IP-based Geocoder providers

Most of them also support reverse geocoding. And of course you can write your own providers on top.

Also new:
- MYSQL support
- PostgreSQL support

## Installation & Docs

- [Documentation](docs/README.md)


### Branching strategy
The master branch is the currently active and maintained one and works with the current 3.x stable version.
Please see the original [Tools plugin](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-tools) if you need the Geo tools for CakePHP 2.x versions.

### TODOs

* Write own Geocoder provider to leverage all of MapsGoogle data that is being returned.
